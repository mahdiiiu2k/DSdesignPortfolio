# Email Setup for Netlify Deployment

## Problem Fixed
Your contact form was showing "Message sent successfully" but you weren't receiving emails because:
- Netlify only hosts static sites (no backend server)
- The Gmail SMTP functionality only works when the backend server is running (like on Replit)
- When deployed to Netlify, the backend isn't available

## Solution Implemented
I've created a serverless function that uses SendGrid to send emails directly from Netlify.

## Setup Required

### 1. Get SendGrid API Key
1. Go to [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com/) and create a free account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Create a new API key with "Mail Send" permissions
4. Copy the API key (it starts with `SG.`)

### 2. Add API Key to Netlify
1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to your site
2. Go to Site Settings > Environment Variables
3. Add a new variable:
   - **Key**: `SENDGRID_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your SendGrid API key (starting with `SG.`)

### 3. Verify Sender Domain (Important!)
For SendGrid to work properly, you need to verify your sender email:

1. In SendGrid, go to Settings > Sender Authentication
2. Click "Verify a Single Sender"
3. Use an email you control (like your Gmail: chouikimahdiabderrahmane@gmail.com)
4. Complete the verification process

### 4. Update the Function (if needed)
After sender verification, update the `from` field in `netlify/functions/send-email.js`:
```javascript
from: 'chouikimahdiabderrahmane@gmail.com', // Use your verified sender email
```

## How It Works Now
1. User fills out contact form
2. Form submits to both:
   - Netlify Forms (as backup in your Netlify admin)
   - SendGrid serverless function (sends email to your inbox)
3. You receive the email directly in your Gmail inbox

## Testing
After setting up the SendGrid API key:
1. Deploy your updated site to Netlify
2. Fill out the contact form on your live site
3. You should receive an email within minutes

## Backup System
Even if SendGrid fails, submissions are still saved in your Netlify Forms panel (Site Settings > Forms).
