# Email Setup for Netlify Deployment

## Problem Fixed
Your contact form was showing "Message sent successfully" but you weren't receiving emails because:
- Netlify only hosts static sites (no backend server)
- The Gmail SMTP functionality only works when the backend server is running (like on Replit)
- When deployed to Netlify, the backend isn't available

## Solution Implemented
I've created a serverless function using your existing Gmail email system (nodemailer) to work on Netlify.

## Setup Required - Add Gmail Credentials to Netlify

### 1. In your Netlify dashboard:
1. Go to your site settings
2. Navigate to Environment Variables
3. Add these two variables:
   - **Key**: `GMAIL_USER`
   - **Value**: `chouikimahdu@gmail.com` (your Gmail address)
   
   - **Key**: `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
   - **Value**: Your Gmail App Password (see step 2)

### 2. Get Gmail App Password (if you don't have one):
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication if not already enabled
3. Go to Security > App Passwords
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)

## How It Works Now
1. User fills out contact form
2. Form submits to both:
   - Netlify Forms (as backup in your Netlify admin)
   - Your existing Gmail email system (sends email to your inbox)
3. You receive beautifully formatted emails in your Gmail inbox using your existing template

## Testing
After adding the Gmail credentials to Netlify:
1. Deploy your updated site to Netlify
2. Fill out the contact form on your live site
3. You should receive an email within minutes

## Backup System
Even if the email fails, submissions are still saved in your Netlify Forms panel (Site Settings > Forms).
