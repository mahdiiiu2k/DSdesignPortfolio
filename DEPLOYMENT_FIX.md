# DEPLOYMENT FIX GUIDE

## Email Address Corrected
Updated email recipient from `chouikimahdiabderrahmane@gmail.com` to `chouikimahdu@gmail.com`

## 404 Error Analysis
The 404 error suggests the Netlify function isn't deployed yet. This can happen because:

1. **Netlify hasn't redeployed yet** - Check your Netlify dashboard for recent deployments
2. **Build failed** - Check Netlify build logs for any errors
3. **Function directory not recognized** - Verify `netlify.toml` has correct functions directory

## Quick Checks:

### 1. Test Replit (Should Work)
- Contact form on this Replit site should work perfectly
- Emails will be sent to `chouikimahdu@gmail.com`

### 2. Check Netlify Deployment
Go to your Netlify dashboard and check:
- **Recent deploys** - Look for automatic deployment after GitHub push
- **Functions tab** - Verify `contact` function is listed
- **Build logs** - Check for any build errors

### 3. Manual Redeploy (If Needed)
If no automatic deployment happened:
- Go to Netlify dashboard
- Click "Deploy" â†’ "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"

## Current Status:
- âœ… **Files**: All function files created and pushed to GitHub
- âœ… **Email Address**: Corrected to `chouikimahdu@gmail.com`
- âœ… **Replit**: Should work perfectly now
- ðŸ”„ **Netlify**: Waiting for deployment/redeploy

Test the contact form on Replit now - it should work and send emails to the correct address.
