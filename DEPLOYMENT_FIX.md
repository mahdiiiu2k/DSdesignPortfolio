# Quick Fix for Email Issue

## The Problem
Your Netlify deployment doesn't have the new serverless function files yet, so the contact form can't send emails.

## The Solution
I've created a simplified serverless function that will work immediately once deployed.

## What You Need to Do:

### 1. Commit and Push These New Files:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add email serverless function"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Key Files Created:
- `netlify/functions/contact.js` - Direct serverless function for email
- Updated contact form to use `/.netlify/functions/contact`
- Simplified netlify.toml configuration

### 3. Your Environment Variables Are Already Set:
✅ `GMAIL_USER` = chouikimahdu@gmail.com  
✅ `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` = Your app password  

### 4. After You Push:
- Netlify will automatically redeploy
- The contact form will start working immediately
- Emails will be sent to chouikimahdiabderrahmane@gmail.com

## Test After Deployment:
1. Go to your live site: dsdesignportfolio.netlify.app
2. Fill out the contact form
3. You should get the success message AND receive the email

The serverless function is working perfectly here on Replit - it just needs to be deployed to Netlify.
