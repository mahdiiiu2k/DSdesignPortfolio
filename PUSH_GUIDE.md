# What You Need to Push to GitHub

Since automatic git push isn't available, you need to manually upload these files to your GitHub repository:

## Required Files for Netlify Email to Work:

### 1. netlify/functions/contact.js
This is the serverless function that sends emails on Netlify. Copy the exact content from the file in this Replit project.

### 2. netlify/functions/package.json
```json
{
  "name": "netlify-functions",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "nodemailer": "^6.9.8"
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist/public"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
```

### 4. Updated contact form (client/src/components/sections/cta.tsx)
The form now has smart detection that automatically uses the right endpoint for each platform.

## How to Upload:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Create the netlify/functions/ folder
3. Upload the contact.js and package.json files
4. Update the netlify.toml file
5. Commit the changes

## Result:
- Netlify will automatically redeploy
- Contact form will work on both Replit and Netlify
- Emails will be sent to chouikimahdiabderrahmane@gmail.com

Your environment variables are already set in Netlify, so once these files are uploaded, everything will work immediately.
