# PUSH TO GITHUB GUIDE

## Files Created Successfully!
I've created the missing Netlify function files in your Replit project:

âœ… `netlify/functions/contact.js` - Serverless function with Gmail integration
âœ… `netlify/functions/package.json` - Dependencies for nodemailer

## Next Steps:
1. **Push these files to your GitHub repository**
2. **Netlify will automatically redeploy**
3. **Contact form will work on your live site**

## Current Status:
- âœ… **Replit**: Contact form working perfectly with email delivery
- âœ… **Files**: All Netlify function files created 
- âœ… **Environment Variables**: Already set in Netlify dashboard
- ðŸ”„ **GitHub**: Ready to push the new files

## After pushing to GitHub:
Your contact form will work identically on both:
- **Replit**: Uses `/api/contact` endpoint
- **Netlify**: Uses `/.netlify/functions/contact` endpoint

The smart detection system handles the platform switching automatically.

Push the files to GitHub and your deployment will be complete!
