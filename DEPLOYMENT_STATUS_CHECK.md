# Deployment Status Check

## Current Issue
The `contact-fixed.js` function returns 404, meaning it hasn't been deployed to Netlify yet.

## Immediate Action Required

### Option 1: Use Existing Working Function
Update your frontend to use the function that's already deployed:

**Check these endpoints:**
- `/.netlify/functions/contact`
- `/.netlify/functions/contact-simple`

### Option 2: Deploy the Fixed Function
1. **Push the new files to GitHub**:
   - `netlify/functions/contact-fixed.js`
   - Updated `client/src/components/sections/cta.tsx`

2. **Trigger Netlify deployment**

3. **Wait for deployment to complete**

4. **Test the new function**

## Quick Fix: Update Frontend to Use Working Function

Since we know the issue is just the `createTransporter` vs `createTransport` typo, 
I can fix the existing deployed function by updating the frontend to use `contact` 
instead of `contact-fixed` and we'll apply the same fix to that function.

## Function Status Check
- ✅ `contact` - Deployed (but has typo)
- ✅ `contact-simple` - Deployed (but has typo)  
- ❌ `contact-fixed` - Not deployed yet

The fastest solution is to fix one of the existing functions and redeploy.
