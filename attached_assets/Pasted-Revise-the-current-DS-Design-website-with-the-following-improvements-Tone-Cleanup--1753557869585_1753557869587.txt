Revise the current DS Design website with the following improvements:


---

🧼 Tone Cleanup:

Remove the overly corporate or developer-heavy language like:

> “Elite professional team collaboration”
“Premium digital craftsmanship”
“Unprecedented speed and sophistication”




✅ Replace with a friendly version:

> “We’re a small team of designers focused on building great websites fast — without the agency overhead.”

Keep the current referral steps but add this line below the form:

✏️ Text Corrections:

Replace the line “Take Your Digital Apparence ToAnother Level” with:

> “Take Your Business Online – In Just 24 Hours”



Change:

> “Real websites we've built for local businesses — delivered fast and ready to drive results”
✅ To: “Just a few websites we’ve delivered for small businesses — fast, clean, and mobile-ready.”
