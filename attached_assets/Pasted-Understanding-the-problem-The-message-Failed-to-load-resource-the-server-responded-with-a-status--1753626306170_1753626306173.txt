Understanding the problem
The message "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()" indicates that the web server could not find the resource (like an image, script, stylesheet, etc.) that the browser requested. The 404 status code is a standard HTTP response meaning "Not Found". [1, 2]

Common reasons for this error include:

The URL for the requested resource is incorrect.
The resource has been moved, renamed, or deleted on the server. [3, 4]
The resource was never uploaded to the correct location on the server.
There might be an issue with the server configuration or routing, especially with virtual directories or dynamic content. [4]
How to verify
Identify the specific resource: Look at the line in the DevTools console where the error appears. It should also list the URL of the resource that failed to load.
Check the URL: Copy the problematic URL and paste it directly into your browser's address bar. If you get a 404 error page, it confirms the resource is not accessible at that URL.
Inspect the Network tab: In Chrome DevTools, go to the "Network" tab. Reload the page. Look for the request that failed with a 404 status code. This tab provides detailed information about the request and response, including the requested URL.
Suggested fix
Verify the resource path: Check the code where the resource is referenced (e.g., an <img> tag's src, a <link> tag's href, or a <script> tag's src). Ensure the URL or path to the resource is spelled correctly and points to the expected location relative to the HTML file or the web server's root.
Confirm the resource exists on the server: Log in to your web server or hosting platform and navigate to the directory where the resource should be located. Verify that the file exists and that its filename matches exactly (including case sensitivity) the one used in your code.
Check server configuration (if applicable): If you are using virtual directories, aliases, or server-side routing, ensure that the server is correctly configured to map the requested URL path to the actual file location on the server. [4]
For example, if the error is for an image:

html

<!-- Original (might be incorrect path) -->
<img src="/images/my_awesome_picture.png" alt="My Picture">
Use code snippets with caution

After verification, you might find the correct path is different:

html

<!-- Corrected path -->
<img src="/assets/img/my_awesome_picture.png" alt="My Picture">
Use code snippets with caution

Summary
A 404 Not Found error means the server couldn't find the requested resource. To fix it, verify the resource's URL in your code and confirm that the resource exists at the correct location on the server.
