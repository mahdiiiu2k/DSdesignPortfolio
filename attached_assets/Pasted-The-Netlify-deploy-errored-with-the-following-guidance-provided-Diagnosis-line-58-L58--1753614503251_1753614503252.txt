The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
[line 58](#L58): The build failed with a non-zero exit code during the 'building site' stage.
[line 59](#L59): The error "Missing script: 'build:static'" indicates that the script 'build:static' is not defined in the npm scripts.
[line 73](#L73): The build command specified in the Netlify configuration file (netlify.toml) is trying to run 'npm run build:static', but the script is missing.

### Solution
1. Verify that the script 'build:static' is defined in the project's npm scripts in the package.json file or the correct script name is being used.
   
2. Add the 'build:static' script to the project's package.json file. If the script is missing, you can add it like this:
   
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "build:static": "your build command here"
    }
    ```

3. After adding the script, ensure that it builds correctly locally before attempting to deploy it again.

By following these steps, the build should be able to find and execute the 'build:static' script successfully.
